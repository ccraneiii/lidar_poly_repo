# Input file for Tyndall field sweep.  The sweep will consist of two
#     passed, i.e. up and back.
field_data:
   # The southwest corner point of the field.  The point is defined as
   #    latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.  The field angle is
   #    measured from the East direction.  Field area is given in units
   #    of m^2.
